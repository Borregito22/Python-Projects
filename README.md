# Python-Projects
This repository will be where I store my Python Projects. They use different modules such as Tkinter and SQLite3.

Projects:
Phonebook
File Transfer GUI
Bank Account Tracker

Phonebook
This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It stores a person's name, number, and email in a database and allows the user to update or delete stored contacts.

File Transfer GUI
This project allows a user to transfer files from a chosen directory to another that have been modified or added within the last 24 hours. All files that have been moved will be saved in a database.

Bank Account Tracker
This project functions as a tracker for different bank accounts. It allows the user to save multiple accounts and view the transactions for each account. It shows the total amount for each account.
